For the little music lover in your life, this sturdy, pink toy piano from GoPlus has it all, including a little stool and the ability to open. 

This was our daughter's for a while, so there's a little cosmetic damage. The stool is a bit wobbly, but that can be stabilized with a screw. But, look, whoever gets this is going to be banging the ever-loving crap out of it, so it's all academic, right? It's not like this going next to the armoire in the living room. 

In fact, it's not that big, so it can easily fit in a bedroom or a corner of the living room. 

Cash only. No trades. Thank you very much."

Professionally framed print. Image measures 9x13 inches, and overall frame about 16x20 inches. I think this was part of a series of French citizens in traditional dress. A close-up shows some lines; not sure if they’re on the glass or what, but not obvious in normal viewing. Edge of the frame needs some paint touch-up. Attractive piece overall, and I’m asking $30. Would consider some old piano rolls in trade too. Hey, for thirty bucks I’ll deliver it to the city of Ithaca..or you can pick it up on Route 13 near Etna.

I don’t carry a smartphone, so just shoot me an email and I’ll get back to you when I can."

Vintage 1960's AKG  D707 E  Dynamic Microphone    

A vintage 1960s AKG D707 microphone. If you're after a high-quality, all-purpose workhorse, look no further. 
These were/are a mainstay in the Beatles' and Abbey Road Studios equipment toolbox. They are crisp, versatile and beautiful looking microphones, exceptionally crafted in Austria. 
This is fully working as designed and sounds excellent. If I remember correctly, this is the model microphone that John Lennon used on both the piano and vocals on his song, ""Imagine.""
Pick it up while you have the chance because working mics of this model don't last long. 
This one is priced to move. ;)

If the ad is up, it's still available

$125 OBO  Pick up in N Broome"

Epson Scanner.  I used it occasionally for documents and it worked fine for that, but the box says it will scan negatives and slides too.  For thirty bucks I can deliver to city of Ithaca or close by, same with Cortland, and you can double-check it on your computer. Or, I'll take less if you'd like to pick it up; I'm near Etna on route 13. Comes with the AC adapter, connecting cable and a software CD. 

Would consider some piano rolls in trade.

The Epson website still offers support, look there to make sure it's compatible with your current computer. I don't carry a smartphone, so just email your contact info and I'll get back to you, probably in the evening."

In good condition and professionally tuned in the last year. Local pick-up only. 

We believe, the Mason & Hamlin Grand Piano was manufactured in the United States in 1928. Known for their high-quality craftsmanship, Mason & Hamlin pianos are highly regarded in the music industry.

Additionally, we believe, the Model A is a 5’8” (173 cm) grand piano, making it a mid-sized piano. It’s well-suited for both home use and smaller concert venues.

Has Piano Life Saved system installed - humidity control unit."
