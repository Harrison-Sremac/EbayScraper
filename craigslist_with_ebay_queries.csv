Triangle Plaisir Zeta,$0,N Syracuse,2025-03-08T10:12:47-0500,"QR Code Link to This Post


Excellent cond., Triangle Plaisir Zeta which is essentially the same speaker as the gloss painted Color series.  Hard to find in the US and was a 5 star performer from reviews.  Treated paper woofer and Titanium tweeter.  Presents a very euphonic sound with good clarity for movies but also very musical for any type of music.  Most versatile speaker I ever had.  Likes all genres, plays with any amp whether class AB or D, inexpensive or hi end but scales up wit better equipment a bit.  For a budget speaker, this has beat out other speakers in enjoyment even up to nearly 2 grand.   Definitely a foot tapping experience with these and only selling because I need to downsize and have much higher end gear.

A great first speaker that won't easily be replaced.   I am the original owner and purchased brand new in Dec 2019.  I liked these over the Borea 2 and these image better with better spatial articulation than the Titus EZ.  The woofer is treated and will last many years over untreated paper comes IMO.  Comes with original box and packing material.  

Asking $185  -  Original retail was approx $450 when first introduced

  No need to replace the woofer it sounds great.

Adcom Based System,$600,Parish,2025-03-01T09:18:19-0500,"QR Code Link to This Post


Adcom Based System $600.00 

For sale are all the main components needed to make a complete stereo system. The $600.00 price covers the Adcom Pre-Amp, Adcom Amp, Paradigm Speakers and the Adcom CD player. The RCA cable connection between the amp and pre-amp and the speaker cables are included. I will also include an extra 1 meter RCA cable that can be used to hook up the CD player, etc.. I just acquired a fantastic sounding Adcom GCD575 CD Player. I will include the GCD575 as part of the system in the asking price.

Please note that the individual component average selling prices, shown below, are only shown so that you know their worth and the worth of the system. The mix was put together because there was a good match in overall sound and balance.

Component - Manufacturer – Average selling price without shipping and sales tax

Pre Amplifier – Adcom GTP 400 - $200.00 ($25 - $35 Shipping + sales tax)
Amplifier – Adcom GFA 535 II 60 W/8 ohm - $250.00 ($50 - $60 Shipping + sales tax)
Speakers - (Pair) Paradigm 3SE- $170.00 ($60 - $75 Shipping + sales tax)
CD Player – Adcom GCD 575 - $189.00 ($25 - $35 Shipping + sales tax)
Turntable – Technics SL-D93 w/ Pickering TL-2S - $150.00 ($50 - $60 Shipping + sales tax)
RCA Cable - Monster ½ meter 550i - $45.00
RCA Cable - Monster 1 meter 550i - $45.00
Speaker Wire - (Pair) Monster MCX-1s Length 8’ - $72.00

The total value of this system is $782.00. That value does not include shipping or sales tax, or the value of the GCD 575 CD Player.

The GTP 400 has a phono input. So if you want to use a turntable you would not need a separate phono preamp. Since there is a built-in phono preamp I have an added offer. I have a Technics SL-D93 with Pickering TL-2S cartridge. This combo is worth at least $150.00. If interested you could include it for an additional $100.00. The turntable and cartridge are in great working condition, the dust cover is not broken, but has some scratches that can be buffed out. This offer would give you a complete turnkey system to listen to vinyl.

Although this system is close to vintage, it sounds better than today's average integrated amp and will rival some of the high end separates that cost far more. If interested, bring some of your favorite music for an audition. This system sounds amazing; it would be well worth your time for a listen. Documentation and specs included. Pickup Only, no shipping.",https://syracuse.craigslist.org/ele/d/parish-adcom-based-system/7830822854.html,"""adcom based system"" -parts -repair"

Up for sale is a Yamaha M-45 Natural Sound Stereo Power Amplifier. This amplifier is in great condition and works and looks great! There is no remote for the amplifier. I have been using this amp with a Yamaha CX-2 Natural Sound Pre-Amplifier to drive a set of beautiful NHT 2.5i floor standing tower speakers (piano finish).  I do have the remote for the pre-amp. Everything is in terrific condition and sounds amazing together. This is a quality lot of home stereo equipment.  If you are interested in the lot, I am asking $1200 (firm). I have the original boxes for these large heavy speaker. This setup is truly for the audiophile.

B&K Based System,$600,Parish,2025-02-17T10:15:03-0500,"QR Code Link to This Post


B&K Stereo System $600.00, originally made in Buffalo, N.Y.

For sale are all the main components needed to make a complete stereo system. The $600.00 price is for the B&K Pre-Amp, B&K Amp, and Polk Speakers, and the Cambridge CD Player. The RCA cable connection between the amp and pre-amp and the speaker cables are included. I will also include an extra 1 meter RCA cable that can be used to hook up the CD player, etc. I just acquired a fantastic sounding Cambridge Audio D500 CD player. I will include the D500 as part of the system in the asking price. I also have a Klipsch KSW-10 subwoofer that could be added. This is something we could negotiate

Please note that the individual component average selling prices shown below are only shown so that you know their worth, and the worth of the System. The mix was put together because there was a good match in overall sound and balance.

Component - Manufacturer – Average selling price without shipping and sales tax

Pre Amplifier - B&K PT3 Series II - $200.00 ($25 - $35 Shipping + sales tax)
Amplifier - B&K ST- 260 60 W/8 ohm - $250.00 ($50 - $60 Shipping + sales tax)
Speakers - (Pair) Polk RT7 - $165.00 ($60 - $75 Shipping + sales tax)
CD Player – Cambridge Audio D500 - $250.00 ($25 - $35 Shipping + sales tax)
Sub Woofer – Klipsch KSW-10 - $100.00 ($50 - $60 Shipping + sales tax)
RCA Cable - Monster ½ meter 550i - $45.00
RCA Cable - Monster 1 meter 550i - $45.00
Speaker Wire - (Pair) Monster MCX-1s Length 8’ - $72.00

The total value of this system is $777.00. That value does not include shipping or sales tax, or the value of the D500 CD Player.

The PT3 is missing the original remote, but a new Redi Remote is included. The PT3 does not have a phono input. So if you want to use a turntable you would need a phono preamp such as a NAD-PP1 or PP2, or a turntable with a built in preamp, such as a Fluance RT81. I also just acquired a Pro-Ject PhonoBox phono preamplifier. If interested, it too can be added, again this is something we could negotiate.

Although this system is close to vintage, it sounds better than today's average integrated amp and will rival some of the high end separates that cost far more. If interested, bring some of your favorite music for an audition. This system sounds amazing; it would be well worth your time for a listen. Documentation and specs included. Pickup Only, no shipping.",https://syracuse.craigslist.org/ele/d/parish-bk-based-system/7827407621.html,"""b&k based system"" -parts -repair"

Up for sale is a hi-fi delight, 5.1 surround sound speaker set. 

The core of the system is two Aperion Audio Intimus 4t towers. Rich, pure, and expressive, these are a joy to listen to records in 2.0, and fill the room during movies with rich, detailed sound. 

Zooming around the sides, are two Aperion Audio Intimus 4b bookshelf speakers. Complete with speaker stands, these speakers pack a wallop for their size and will make you jump out of your chair in scary movie scenes (they're always behind you).

The center channel is a giant Klipsch Reference RC-52. Bringing voices to center stage in movies and tv, this speaker blends beautifully with the full throated power of the towers. 

Bringing the bass, is a monoprice premium 200 watt subwoofer. With an 8"" downward firing cone and a front port, you'll get all the rumble you want.  Adjust crossover and volume right on the unit so you can have as much or as little as you want. 

This system has been absolutely awesome for me for movies, music, and video games.
