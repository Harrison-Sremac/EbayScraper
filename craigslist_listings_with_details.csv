Vintage 1960's AKG  D707 E  Dynamic Microphone    
$125 OBO  Pick up in N Broome
A vintage 1960s AKG D707 microphone. If you're after a high-quality, all-purpose workhorse, look no further. 
These were/are a mainstay in the Beatles' and Abbey Road Studios equipment toolbox. They are crisp, versatile and beautiful looking microphones, exceptionally crafted in Austria. 
This is fully working as designed and sounds excellent. If I remember correctly, this is the model microphone that John Lennon used on both the piano and vocals on his song, ""Imagine.""
Pick it up while you have the chance because working mics of this model don't last long. 
This one is priced to move. ;)",https://syracuse.craigslist.org/msg/d/syracuse-vintage-1960s-akg-d707-dynamic/7830600734.html

Up for sale is a Yamaha M-45 Natural Sound Stereo Power Amplifier. This amplifier is in great condition and works and looks great! There is no remote for the amplifier.
